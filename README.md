# Hi there, I'm Risper Ndirangu! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm a data enthusiast, data scientist, and Machine learning Engineer based in Nairobi, Kenya. I'm passionate about leveraging data to drive insights and make informed decisions.

## Programming languages 
- Python, R, SQL
  
## Frameworks & Libraries: 
TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, Hugging Face Transformers

## Tools: 
Git, Docker, Postman, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, VS Code

## Projects
Here are some of my notable projects:
1. [YOUR AI CHATBOT](https://github.com/Risper8/YOURAI_RAGCHAT) -  Your AI Chat is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application designed to help learners understand artificial intelligence (AI) in depth by answering questions about AI concepts.
   
2. [Medical Note Extraction - H2O GenAI World NY](https://github.com/Risper8/Medical-Note-Extraction-H2O-GenAI-) - This challenge by H2O focused on transforming medical notes into a structured JSON format, making the data more accessible and easier to analyze.

3. [Zindi Challenges](https://github.com/Risper8/Zindi-Challenges) - This is a repository that contains the notebooks for the challenges I have participated on Zindi. Still in progress.

4. [Skin Cancer Image Classification](https://github.com/Risper8/Skin-Cancer-Prediction) - fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 pretrained model for skin cancer classification, achieving 86% accuracy for cancer type prediction and 92% for severity (malignant vs. benign).
   
5. [Skin Cancer Segmentation](https://github.com/Risper8/Skin_Cancer_Segmentation) - Developed a U-NET model that focuses on the segmentation of skin cancer images to aid in the identification and analysis of cancerous lesions, achieving 95% accuracy
  
6. [Churn Prediction](https://github.com/Risper8/Churn-Prediction)- Utilized Python and machine learning techniques to predict churn using data from a telecommunication company
  
## Education

- Bachelor of Science in Statistics and Programming from Kenyatta University - Expected graduation in December 2024.
  
- KCB Data Science and AI Training Program -  I completed a 4-month data science and AI program, earning a certificate. The program covered various aspects of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning.
