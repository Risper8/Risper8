# Hi there, I'm Risper Ndirangu! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm a data enthusiast, data scientist, and aspiring Machine learning/AI Engineer based in Nairobi, Kenya. I'm passionate about leveraging data to drive insights and make informed decisions.

## Programming languages 
- Python, R, SQL
  
## Frameworks & Libraries: 
TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, pandas, NumPy, Transformers 

## Tools: 
Beautiful Soup, Selenium, Tableau, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Git

## Projects
Here are some of my notable projects:
1. [Predicting US Home Prices](https://github.com/Risper8/Home-Prices-in-US) - Utilized Python and machine learning techniques to predict home prices in the US over the past 20 years.
   
2. [Churn Prediction](https://github.com/Risper8/Churn-Prediction)- Utilized Python and machine learning techniques to predict churn using data from a telecommunication company
   
3. [YOUR AI CHATBOTl](https://github.com/Risper8/YOURAI_RAGCHAT) -  Your AI Chat is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application designed to help learners understand artificial intelligence (AI) in depth by answering questions about AI concepts.

4. [Skin Cancer Image Classification](https://github.com/Risper8/Skin-Cancer-Prediction) - fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 pretrained model for skin cancer classification, achieving 86% accuracy for cancer type prediction and 92% for severity (malignant vs. benign).
   
5. [Skin Cancer Segmentation](https://github.com/Risper8/Skin_Cancer_Segmentation) - Developed a U-NET model that focuses on the segmentation of skin cancer images to aid in the identification and analysis of cancerous lesions, achieving 95% accuracy
   
6. [Body_part classification](https://github.com/Risper8/Body-Parts-Classification) - This is a prediction model that can predict the body parts of a human being from images, achieving 91% accuracy
  
## Education

- Bachelor of Science in Statistics and Programming from Kenyatta University - Expected graduation in December 2024.
  
- KCB Data Science and AI Training Program -  I completed a 4-month data science and AI program, earning a certificate. The program covered various aspects of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning.
