# Hi there, I'm Risper Ndirangu! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm a data enthusiast, data scientist, and aspiring Machine learning/AI Engineer based in Nairobi, Kenya. I'm passionate about leveraging data to drive insights and make informed decisions.

While my expertise lies in data science and AI, I'm eager to explore new technologies like web3 to expand my skill set.


## Programming languages 
- Python, R, SQL
  
## Frameworks & Libraries: 
TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, pandas, NumPy, Transformers 

## Tools: 
Beautiful Soup, Selenium, Tableau, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Git

## Projects
Here are some of my notable projects:
1. [Predicting US Home Prices](https://github.com/Risper8/Home-Prices-in-US) - Utilized Python and machine learning techniques to predict home prices in the US over the past 20 years.
   
2. [Churn Prediction](https://github.com/Risper8/Churn-Prediction)- Utilized Python and machine learning techniques to predict churn using data from a telecommunication company
   
3. [NLP Prediction model](https://github.com/Risper8/NLP-Skin-Disease) -  Developed a model using sentence transformers to predict skin diseases and associated symptoms based on user input.

4. [Skin Cancer Image Classification](https://github.com/Risper8/Skin-Cancer-Prediction) - fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 pretrained model for skin cancer classification, achieving 86% accuracy for cancer type prediction and 92% for severity (malignant vs. benign).
   
5. [Women in Data Science (WiDS) Datathon](https://www.kaggle.com/code/risperndirangu/wids-datathon) - Participated in the WiDS Datathon focused on addressing healthcare inequity, particularly in the timely diagnosis and treatment of metastatic cancer. Utilized Python and machine learning techniques for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
6.  [Weather Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/code/risperndirangu/weather-prediction) - Analyzed historical weather data using Python to identify patterns and trends, and visualize climate changes over time.

## Experience

- Data Scientist and Market Researcher Intern at AICE - Leveraged TensorFlow and PyTorch for skin cancer and gender classification, built an NLP disease prediction model, 
 and developed AI course materials and proposals for AI-powered tools integration in various industries.
  
- Research Assistant at Exactitude Research Consultants - Conducted desktop research and data analysis for various projects, enhancing research findings.
  
## Education

- Bachelor of Science in Statistics and Programming from Kenyatta University - Expected graduation in December 2024.
  
- KCB Data Science and AI Training Program -  I completed a 4-month data science and AI program, earning a certificate. The program covered various aspects of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning.
